    <div class="prose prose-stone prose-a:text-blue-700 max-w-none">
      <p><strong>Notice: this is a work in progress and not yet enforced.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at <em>Breaking the Silos</em> events are
required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from
all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
<h3 id="the-quick-version">The Quick Version</h3>
<p><em>Breaking the Silos</em> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue,
including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, Meetup, Discord and other online media.
Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the event <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion
of the event organisers.</p>
<h3 id="the-less-quick-version">The Less Quick Version</h3>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organisers
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff
immediately. Event staff can be identified as they&rsquo;ll be wearing
branded t-shirts.</p>
<p>Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
event. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop
venues and social events related to <em>Breaking the Silos</em>.</p>
